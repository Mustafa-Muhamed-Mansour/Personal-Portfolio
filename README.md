<summary>ch 2 : Defining</summary>

* **val** (from value)—Immutable reference. A variable declared with val can’t be
reassigned after it’s initialized. It corresponds to a **final** variable in Java. 

* **var** (from variable)—Mutable reference. The value of such a variable can be changed. This declaration corresponds to a regular (**non-final**) 

* Using **immutable references**, immutable objects, and
functions without side effects makes your code closer to the functional style.
